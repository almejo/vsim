VSim
=========

Dillinger is digital circuits simulator.

Vsim is a rewrite from scratch of my University Thesis JCSim. You can try JCSim from my [bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/almejo/jcsim).

VSim is in very early stage of development and it lacks a lot of features that JCSim already has. Simulation of gates and pins is working but it lacks a proper interface.

VSim, as JCSim, will be usefull to understand how digital circuits works. In the future it could be used to teach or for homework. 

Features
-

JCSim can do a lot of things. Add/remove gates, interconnect them and simulate the circuit. But also it some design problems that make it difficult to fix. Some things that VSim will have are:

- Proper cut, copy and paste
- Undo/Redo
- Better interface
- Proper Save and Load. JCSim serialize the complete circuit.

Why a new Program? Why not fix JCSim
-

The main reason is fun. I love to code and doing it from scratch is a lot of fun. Also, this way I can remember all the process to create it and think again about the design. I am not throwing it away, I am using the best parts.
